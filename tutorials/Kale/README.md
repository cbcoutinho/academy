# Kale Tutorials

In here you'll find the code samples from our Kale tutorials.

Kale bridges this gap by providing a simple UI to define Pipelines workflows directly from you JupyterLab interface, without the need to change a single line of code.

A Pipeline is the basic Machine Learning workflow. including all of the components and how they function in an integrated fashion. Each pipeline includes the inputs parameters required to run the pipeline and the inputs and output artifacts of each component. The way you design the pipelines determines the data-flow and inter-dependencies within each pipeline block.

A pipeline block is a self-contained set of code, packaged as a Docker image, that performs one step in the pipeline. Each component can be designed to perform a set of tasks in its suitable Docker environment.
